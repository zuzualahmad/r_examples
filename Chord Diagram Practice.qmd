# Creating a sample matrix for the chord diagram
matrix_data <- matrix(c(
  0, 20, 30, 40,
  10, 0, 50, 60,
  70, 80, 0, 90,
  20, 30, 40, 0

dimnames = list(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), c("A", "B", "C", "D")))
# Drawing the chord diagram
chordDiagram(matrix_data)


```

```{r}
# Assume matrix_data is defined with dimnames as sectors "A", "B", "C", "D"
# Ensure you have a color for each sector
sector_names = colnames(matrix_data) # or rownames(matrix_data) since it should be the same
col = rand_color(length(sector_names))

# Name the colors vector for clarity and direct mapping (optional but helpful)
names(col) = sector_names

# Drawing the chord diagram with specified colors
chordDiagram(matrix_data, grid.col = col)


```

```{r}
library(circlize)
# Generate a color vector with rainbow
col = rainbow(length(sector_names))

# Optionally, name the vector to match sector names
names(col) = sector_names

# Draw the diagram
chordDiagram(matrix_data, grid.col = col)
