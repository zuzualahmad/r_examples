## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

### Quarto files have three components:
1. the YAML header
2. Prose
3. Code

we can format the prose:

* *italics*
* **bold**

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:



```{r car plOT, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```


```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
