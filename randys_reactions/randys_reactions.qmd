## r-chart gallery homework Jan 28, 2024

Nice!  Love the exploration of colors and patterns!  A few things to keep in mind:

* Insert the URL for the code so you can find it again in the future, or share with others
* Nice comments-if you wrote them, great!  If not, note that they are nicely done and can serve as an example
* Line 33 is super interesting.  If you do not understand that one, take a look and see what you can figure out.
* The code for the last barplot is formatted differently-note what is different and which formatting is easiest for you to read and understand.

THANK YOU!
